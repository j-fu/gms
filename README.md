GMS - Graphics Minimal System
=============================

This is stuff  from the mid 90ies. See the tex file for info.

GMS was inspired by  GKS, which at that time didnt have neither X11 nor postscript output.

GMS was/is used for graphics output of [WIAS-TeSCA](https://www.wias-berlin.de/software/tesca/)
